# AR Foundation Elements
AR Elements based on Googles [Augmented Reality Design Guidelines](https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/ar-design/augmented-reality-design-guidelines/introduction.html)

The goal of this project is to create a easy to use starting point for good UI/UX in AR. 

Google has done really good research, I am trying to improve on these ideas.
